# OBDBUpdaterAgency Manifesto

## Mission
The mission of the OBDBUpdaterAgency is to update the Open Brewery Database (OBDB) by creating CSV files according to a specified format. 
These files will be added as part of a pull request to the OBDB GitHub repository. 
The agency will search and scrape the web thoroughly for brewery information mainly from the brewery websites.

## Goals
1. Efficiently gather extensive and accurate brewery information from various sources.
2. Ensure the correctness and accuracy of the information before submission.

## Working Environment
The agency will operate in a collaborative environment where each agent has a distinct role but works towards the common goal of updating the OBDB. 
The agents will use various tools and APIs to perform their tasks and will communicate with each other to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of the process.
