# OBDBUpdaterAgency Manifesto

## Mission
The mission of the OBDBUpdaterAgency is to update the Open Brewery Database (OBDB) by creating CSV files according to a specified format. These files will be added as part of a pull request to the OBDB GitHub repository. The agency will search and scrape the web for brewery information, especially from beer sites like ratebeer.com and untappd.com. The agency will ensure that the CSV files are formatted correctly and that the information is accurate.

## Goals
1. Efficiently gather accurate brewery information from various sources.
2. Create well-formatted CSV files for each county, named with the county name, and located in a folder named with the country name.
3. Ensure the correctness and accuracy of the information before submission.
4. Facilitate smooth communication and task management within the agency.

## Working Environment
The agency will operate in a collaborative environment where each agent has a distinct role but works towards the common goal of updating the OBDB. The agents will use various tools and APIs to perform their tasks and will communicate with each other to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of the process.
